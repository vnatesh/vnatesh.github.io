                            <p>We offer a novel approach to matrix-matrix multiplication computation on computing platforms with memory hierarchies. Constant-bandwidth (CB) blocks improve computation throughput for architectures limited by external memory bandwidth. Configuring the shape and size of CB blocks operating from within any memory hierarchy level (e.g., internal SRAM), we achieve high throughput while holding external bandwidth (e.g., with DRAM) constant. We explain how, surprisingly, CB blocks can maintain constant external bandwidth as computation throughput increases. Analogous to partitioning a cake into pieces, we dub our CB-partitioned system CAKE.
                            We show CAKE outperforms state-of-the-art libraries in computation time on real-world systems (e.g. ARMPL library for ARM CPUs) where external bandwidth represents a bottleneck, demonstrating CAKE's ability to address the memory wall. CAKE achieves superior performance by directly using theoretically optimal CB-partitioned blocks in tiling and scheduling, obviating the need for extensive design search. </p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/sluice-project/sluice">A Network-wide Programming Model</a></h4>
                            <p> This paper presents Sluice, a programming model that takes a network-wide specification of the data plane and compiles it into runnable code that can be launched directly on the programmable devices of a network. In contrast to prior network-wide programming models like SNAP and Maple that were focused on specific tasks (e.g., routing and security policies), Sluice aims to be more generic, but potentially at the cost of operator effort in specifying code placement. Sluice endows network operators with the ability to design and deploy large network programs for various functions such as scheduling, measurement, and in-network applications. The benefits of Sluice can be summarized as follows: (1) Sluice provides the same functionality as a per-device language like P4 but makes it easier to program the data plane of an entire network by abstracting device-specific architectural details like stateful ALUs, pipelines, etc., and (2) Sluice automatically reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to write data plane functionality. For instance, the 8 line traffic matrix Sluice program we demonstrate translates into over 40 lines of P4 (excluding header/metadata/parser definitions and ipv4 forwarding P4 code). We demonstrate Sluice’s functionality and ease of use via two examples: traffic matrix generation for network analysis and a streaming join-filter operation. Sluice is open-source and available at https://github.com/sluice-project/sluice.




                            I designed Sluice, a high-level language for expressing and dispatching programs to run on a programmable network. Currently, network operators are required to use several complex SDKs to program each device in a programmable network. This makes it cumbersome to create whole-network programs. The goal of this project is to abstract away device-specific information and provide the operator with a simple language to create network programs. The compiler translates this high-level language into device-specific code (p4) based on programmer annotations as well as the hardware constraints of each device. The image above displays a Sluice program implementing an inner join over streams of data in a simple 2-switch network.</i>.</p>

                            <p> During the summer of 2018, I developed a system to run SQL-like queries on streams of packets entering a virutal programmable switch. Each stream represents an unbounded table. In addition to standard eth/ip/tcp headers, each packet contains a header representing a row of data made up of fields (column name) and their values. An operator query is run on the virtual switch as a P4-16 program which processes the packet streams and returns the query result. On the left is a demo of a simple JOIN operation between two streams. Host 1 sends a stream of ad impressions while Host 2 sends a stream of ad clicks. The two streams are efficiently joined on the "adId" field at the virtual switch and the query result is sent to Host 3. The MySQL query corresponding to this example is shown below. </p>
                            <p align="left"> SELECT adId, impression_time, click_time <br />
                                FROM impressions i <br />

Random forest and logistic regression were used for VWAP direction classification (up or down), while PCA and random forest were used for feature selection. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to predict real VWAP value. We also used a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict real VWAP value.

                            <p>During the months leading up to the 2016 election, I became curious about the effectiveness of political futures markets in predicting political events. In these markets, the price of a candidate reflects their underlying probability of winning and is a value ranging from $0 to $0.99. If the candidate wins, the contract holder earns $1 and realizes a profit. Otherwise the price of the contract goes to $0 and the buyer loses the whole purchase price i.e. the contract is a binary option. I built a software platform that interfaces with online political markets, such as Predictit.org, and allows for automatic trade execution. After collecting and analyzing price, volume, and polling data for several months, I developed quantitative strategies to trade on. I then used my platform to process streams of incoming price/volume data and algorithmically trade based on the detection of real-time signals. A particularly successful strategy centered around momentum trading using higher-order finite difference methods. </p>

                            <p>I built a lightweight multi-threaded web proxy server in C. The server can handle up to 100 asynchronous requests. Each client creates a TCP connection to the server and transmits a URL string. The server continuously listens for new clients and launches each one on a separate posix thread (pThread). Each time a new URL is queried by a client, the corresponding HTML document is cached at the server. The next time this same url is queried for, the program simply returns the corresponding HTML from the cache. This eases strain on the network by reducing the number of external requests made by the server. A separate thread performs cache validation to update webpages that may have changed.  </p>

                            <p>This paper presents Sluice, a programming model that takes a network-wide specification of the data plane and compiles it into runnable code that can be launched directly on the programmable devices of a network. In contrast to prior network-wide programming models like SNAP and Maple that were focused on specific tasks (e.g., routing and security policies), Sluice aims to be more generic, but potentially at the cost of operator effort in specifying code placement. Sluice endows network operators with the ability to design and deploy large network programs for various functions such as scheduling, measurement, and in-network applications. The benefits of Sluice can be summarized as follows:

                            (1) Sluice provides the same functionality as a per-device language like P4 but makes it easier to program the data plane of an entire network by abstracting device-specific architectural details like stateful ALUs, pipelines, etc., and

                            (2) Sluice automatically reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to write data plane functionality. For instance, the 8 line traffic matrix Sluice program we demonstrate translates into over 40 lines of P4 (excluding header/metadata/parser definitions and ipv4 forwarding P4 code).

                            We demonstrate Sluice’s functionality and ease of use via two examples: traffic matrix generation for network analysis and a streaming join-filter operation. Sluice is open-source and available at https://github.com/sluice-project/sluice.</p>

                            <p>This study investigates the risk factors associated with progression to blindness as a result of POAG in the African-American population. Statistical analysis was conducted per-subject for subject-specific measurements and per-eye for eye-specific measurements. For the subject-specific measurements, the comparison of characteristics between cases and matched controls was performed using the paired t-test for comparing means, Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparing medians, and McNemar’s test for comparing proportions. For eye-specific measurements, generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlations from matching and from paired eyes of a patient. To identify risk factors for blindness, univariate logistic regression models were first performed, followed by a multivariate logistic regression model that included risk factors with p < 0.10 from the univariate analysis. The multivariate logistic model went through backward model selection to reach the final model that only included risk factors at p < 0.05. In these logistic regression analyses, correlations from matching and from paired eyes of a subject were accounted for using generalized estimating equations. It was found that access to care, initial visual acuity worse than 20/40, and poor control of intraocular pressure were the major risk factors associated with blindness from POAG.</p>

                            <p>No method of grading visual field (VF) defects has been widely accepted throughout the glaucoma community. The SCHEIE (Systematic Classification of Humphrey visual fields-Easy Interpretation and Evaluation) grading system for glaucomatous visual fields was created to convey qualitative and quantitative information regarding visual field defects in an objective, reproducible, and easily applicable manner for research purposes. The qualitative score consists of designation in one or more of the following categories: normal, central scotoma, paracentral scotoma, paracentral crescent, temporal quadrant, nasal quadrant, peripheral arcuate defect, expansive arcuate, or altitudinal defect. The quantitative component incorporates the Humphrey visual field index (VFI), location of visual defects for superior and inferior hemifields, and blind spot involvement. </p>
